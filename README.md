# Nomad-Vagrant Cluster

This cluster is used primarily to test Nomad. 

This is a work from a github gist which is modified to not use Vault and spin up a 3 node nomad cluster. The credit of the Vagrantfile to create VMs is to be attributed to this anonymous github gist author. 

Run `vagrant up` to create a 3 node Nomad cluster with Consul.
